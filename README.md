<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Generally, I have used discord as the most social app I usually check every now and then, so I thought it would be really cool to make a program that sends the redminders through discord instead of a normal reminder app because I know I would want to open a notified message on discord more than I do if it was on the built-in reminders app, so here it is, remindME to send scheduled messages through the server you are in. 

Why?
* Your time is valuable and forgetting a task would really feel bad
* You don’t have to go through the complex set-up
* You don’t have to open a bunch of apps 
* All you need is to send the time and a message :dove: 

Now yes you would have to ability on a normal reminder app to edit and change and play with UI, but this bot is mainly designed for those who use discord very often and would like to get their tasks reminded on the same app.
